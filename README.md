Please complete either or both exercise in three languages. Java, Python and Ruby. You may also be able to do these using JavaScript as well! If you want to challenge yourself, _do not start with Ruby_.

Create any new files you require in this repository to complete these exercises. If you would like to submit Pull-Requests as you go, do it! That way you can get some incremental feedback.
